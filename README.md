PYTHON: Huffman Coding

  Uses Huffman Coding to compress a file by finding the frequency of each character and assigning a binary
  number to the character. Once that is done it will run the comparisons to see how much the text file was
  compressed.
  
  Menu Options:
  1. Display Frequency Table (percentage of occurance of each individual character)
  2. Display Binary Table (display the binary digit assigned to each character)
  3. Display Original File (display the original text file before compression)
  4. Display Compressed File (display compressed file after it has been converted)
  5. Display Results Again (display the compression results again)
